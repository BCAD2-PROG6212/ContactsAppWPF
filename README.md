# ContactsAppWPF

Build me a contacts app that allows a user to store information of their contacts including Name, Surname, Phone and Email.
 
Your application should be built to the following technical specifications:
* Use .NET Core
* User Entity Framework
* Built on top of a SQL database

Your application should incorporate the following user functionality:
* A user must be able to login and view their contacts
* A user must be able to create a new contact
* A user must be able to edit an existing contact
* A user must be able to remove a contact

You will need to complete features not in this repo.
